	Imagine the ultimate group project tool that incorporates the functionality of project planning software collaboration from your group members, allowing you to easily find time to meet, and even a way for your professor to check up on you or even grade your work from it. This tool will combine aspects such as designating Project Lead, working together on files, setting milestones, chat functionality and even submission sections for when milestones are complete.
